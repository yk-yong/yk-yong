# 👋 Hi, I'm John

I build software that works in the real world.

My journey started 7 years ago as a Web Development intern, where I obsessed over the fundamentals—mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the intricacies of networking. That foundation allowed me to scale quickly, expanding into mobile app development with React Native and taking ownership of full-stack challenges.

I’ve spent the majority of my career in the startup ecosystem. I thrive in that fast-paced, "zero-to-one" environment where you have to build things from scratch, wear multiple hats, and solve problems immediately.

Furthermore, experienced in leading a small team which consists of 8 members (6 was from local and 2 remote) to help a business scale their frontend development team. What I delivered to the business? Established development practice, design scalable system, automation workflows and implements AI Assistant to improve code quality and team productivity.

Recently, I realized that my unique blend of deep technical skill (Frontend/Mobile/Networking) and startup grit (speed/deployment/autonomy) creates a specific value: I bridge the gap between code and customer success.

Today, I am an Independent Forward Deployed Software Engineer. I help businesses not just write code, but deploy scalable, user-centric solutions across web and mobile.

If you have a complex problem that needs a builder, let’s connect.
